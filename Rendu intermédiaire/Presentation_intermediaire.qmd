## I - Introdution
### A) Context
<br>

- Patients with overactive immune systems awaiting transplantation have difficulties accepting the graft because of the antibodies rejecting the new organ.

<br>

- Desensitization protocols increases transplant candidates access to transplantation by decreasing HLA antibodies.

<br>

- By modeling the decrease of HLA antibodies, we can:
  - improve treatment conditions and future patients access to transplantation;
  - help patients not to do additional sessions when the immunity activity is already below a specific medical threshold


### B) Objectives
<br>

Very different immune profiles with great variability :
<br>

- HLA modelisation as a function of covariates

<br>

-  Define optimized strategy of desensitization for patient

<br>

- Create an R shiny application : visualize antibodies and the immune system complexity


## II - Data overview

### A) Protocol
:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="55%"}

Data collection :

<br>

- 10 patients

<br>

- 10 desimmunisation seances :

  - 2 weeks, 5 days per week

  - 2 data collection time : before and after

  - MFI : Mean Fluorescence Intensity, way of measuring HLA presence in patients bodies

<br>

- 2 big categories of antibodies, 2 MFI by collection

### B) Data description (longitudinal data)
<br>

The dataset contains :  
<br>

- 251 observations made on 10 individuals
<br>

- 34 variables :  
   - general informations about the treatment (date, beginning and ending time, ...) 
   - clinical informatiosn about the treatment (major epitote, locus type, class I MFI, class II MFI, prescribed plasma volume, treated plasma volume, ...)
   - informations about the patient (ID, sex, age, height, weight, number of pregnancy, ...) 

<br>


## III - Methodology
### A) Statistical model

Pharmacokinetic models : how each patient's organism affects the MFI

<br>

Non-linear mixed effects models :

- repeated measurement
- fixed and random effects
- small sample size
 <br>

Tools : Monolix Lixoft and R


### B) Strategy
#### 1. Data management
- Base file : Excel file

- What we want : csv file for easier work later

- How : 1st R program to rectify and structure data

- NA values handling : replaced by the mean value of the patient

- Seance duration recalculation : check the hand written value

- Adding delta MFI calcul

<!-- 
- The variable names are quite difficult to exploit in R because they consists of two rows and small sentences,
we changed them to simple one or two words names with a prefix when necessary
- Data is written manually, there are a some mistypes and errors
- There are missing values, including some we have to complete to be able to do proper modeling
- Some rows aren't data and just additional information, we wanted to remove them

#### 2. Descriptive statistics

#### 3. MFI Modelisation

Up to now, we have studied the variations of the MFI variables so we could have a first idea of how it is evolving and which method we could use to better predict its changes.

We are currently studying the Non Linear Mixed Modeling methods in order to understand how we could ugrade the models we already know.

#### 4. Shiny App


## IV - Future plan
### A) Schedule overview
Some of our remaining goals :

- Find the most suitable model
- Compare R's and Monolix's methods
- Create a Shiny application

### B) Possible scenarios

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="65%"}
<br>
There are 3 possible outcomes for our project :

- Best case : every task is done, the models and the shiny application 
- Most likely case : the modelisation is made but not the app
- Worst case: the model created isn't satisfying enough and the application isn't done
