## I - Introdution
### A) Context
<br>

- Patients with overactive immune systems awaiting transplantation have difficulties accepting the graft because of the antibodies rejecting the new organ.
<br>

- Desensitization protocols increases transplant candidates access to transplantation by decreasing HLA antibodies.
<br>

- By modeling the decrease of HLA antibodies, we can:
  - improve treatment conditions and future patients access to transplantation;
  - help patients not to do additional sessions when the immunity activity is already below a specific medical threshold


### B) Objectives
<br>

- Study the trends in the data
<br>

- Create proper modelling for each of the concerned antibodies
<br>

- Create an R shiny application for the clinicians to use our models

## II - Data & Methods

### A) Data overview
<br>

The dataset contains :  
<br>

- 251 observations made on 10 individuals  
<br>

- 34 variables :  
   - general informations about the treatment (date, beginning and ending time, ...) 
   - clinical informatiosn about the treatment (major epitote, locus type, class I MFI, class II MFI, prescribed plasma volume, treated plasma volume, ...)
   - informations about the patient (ID, sex, age, height, weight, number of pregnancy, ...) 

### B) Methods

## III - Action plan

### A) Data cleaning
Our data is an Excel file database so there are a few problems we have to rectify :

- The variable names are quite difficult to exploit in R because they consists of two rows and small sentences,
we changed them to simple one or two words names with a prefix when necessary
- Data is written manually, there are a some mistypes and errors
- There are missing values, including some we have to complete to be able to do proper modeling
- Some rows aren't data and just additional information, we wanted to remove them

### B) Univariate description
We spent the first part of our project analysing the variables one by one to understand our dataset and have a first idea of which vraiables could be of use in the next steps of our projects.


### C) MFI modelisation
Up to now, we have studied the variations of the MFI variables so we could have a first idea of how it is evolving and which method we could use to better predict its changes.

We are currently studying the Non Linear Mixed Modeling methods in order to understand how we could ugrade the models we already know.




## IV - Future plan
### A) Schedule overview
Some of our remaining goals :
- Find the most suitable model
- Compare R's and Monolix's methods
- Create a Shiny application

### B) Possible scenarios
There are 3 possible outcomes for our project :
- Best case : every task is done, the models and the shiny application 
- Most likely case : the modelisation is made but not the app
- Worst case: the model created isn't satisfying enough and the application isn't done
